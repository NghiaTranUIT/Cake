Swift modules are a really powerful feature of Swift, yet existing tooling makes
modulizing your projects *so* tedious that most people don’t bother doing it.

Your app should be composed of *many* modules, *definitely not just one*,
because:

* **Encapsulation**. Internal scope is a criminally under-utilized Swift feature
    that makes encapsulation significantly more achievable.
* **Namespacing**. Modules have an implicit namespace; fear not about reusing
    names, modulize instead.
* **Hierarchy**. Once you start creating modules you automatically
    arrange them so that some have more importance than others.
    This naturally leads to a *structured* codebase where new files nestle into
    their logical, encapulated homes, *effortlessly*.
* **Organization**. You no longer have to cram everything concerning an area of
    responsibility into a single file to gain from file-private. Instead
    separate all that code out into multiple files in its own module and use
    `internal` access control.
* **Testability**. Making a piece of functionality its own module means you can
    make more of that module internal scope rather than private and this means
    more of the module can be imported `@testable` making the functionality
    easier to test without adopting practices that make your code less readable
    for the sake of testing (like injection).

Cake makes working with Swift modules *a breeze*.

# Xcode 10.2-beta Required

Supporting Swift tools-version-5 and tools-version-4 is not our thing. Cake
requires at least Xcode 10.2 to function.

Hey there, I’m Max Howell. I’m a prolific producer of open source software and
probably you already use some of it (for example, I created [`brew`]). I work
full-time on open source and it’s hard; currently *I earn less than minimum
wage*. Please help me continue my work, I appreciate it 🙏🏻

Cake is an app that runs in your menu bar and watches your Xcode projects. If
you chose to integrate Cake it will automatically generate your module hierarchy
based on your directory structure. For example:

    .
    └ Sources
      └ Model
        ├ Module1
        │ ├ a.swift
        │ └ b.swift
        └ Module2
          ├ c.swift
          └ d.swift

Now **⌘B** and you’ll be able to `import`:

```swift
import Module1
import Module2
```

What is a cake project? It’s one that has a `Cakefile.swift` in its root.

## Module hierarchies

Before long you will need some modules to depend on others. This is an important
step since you are starting to acknowledge the relationships between components
in your codebase. Cake makes dependencies as easy as nesting directories.

    .
    └ Sources
      └ Model
        └ Base
          ├ a.swift
          ├ b.swift
          └ Foo
            ├ c.swift
            └ d.swift

Here `Foo` depends on `Base` and thus, `Foo` can *now* import `Base`.

*All* other tools require you to specify relationships *cryptically* with either
textually or with a confounding GUI. With Cake, use the filesystem,
relationships are not only easy to read, but also, trivial to refactor (just
move the directory).

### What should go in your `Base` module?

Cake uses the Base module for extensions on the standard library.

## Dependencies

You can use CocoaPods or Carthage, but if you want a little more *shazzam* then
why not have Cake handle it?

**In many ways, a legitimate use for Cake is better integration for SwiftPM
packages in Xcode than the current `swift package generate-xcodeproj` dance.**

Write out your [`Cakefile`](Documents/Cakefile.md), **⌘B**, Cake fetches your
deps and integrates them; no muss, no fuss.

```swift
import Cakefile

dependencies = [
    .github("mxcl/Path.swift" ~> 0.8),
    .github("Weebly/OrderedSet" ~> 3),
]
```

We figure out your deployment targets. We make the deps available to *all* your
targets. No pissing about: that’s what Cake’s all about.

Don’t want Cake to manage your deps? Then don’t, it’s
optional (though you can do [more with your Cakefile] than just deps).

We check out your dependencies *tidily*, for example the above `Cakefile` gives
you:

    .
    └ Dependencies
      ├ mxcl/Path.swift-0.8.0
      │ ├ Path.swift
      │ └ …
      └ Weebly∕OrderedSet-3.1.0.swift

Which generates to this in your `Cake.xcodeproj`:

Which you can then commit, *or not commit*: that’s up to you.
[Though we suggest you do](Documents/FAQ.md#should-i-commit-my-deps).

## An era for Swift µ-frameworks?

> “You can do anything, but not everything.” —*David Allen*

CocoaPods and Carthage libraries tend to be on the *large* side, and this is at
lesat partly because being modular has been historically hard and tedious when
developing for Apple platforms and Swift. SwiftPM encourages smaller, tighter
frameworks and using Cake means making apps with Swift packages is now possible.

Choose small, modular, small responsibility libraries with 100% code coverage
that take semantic-versioning **seriously**. Reject bloated libraries that don’t
know how to say no to feature requests.

## Constructing frameworks/dylibs

Since everything Cake builds is a static archive, you can simply link whichever
parts you like into whatever Frameworks or dylibs you need for your final
binaries.

This is a purely optional step, statically linking `Cake.a` into your App (which
Cake sets up by default for you) is perfectly fine. This more advanced option is
available to make apps with extensions more optimal in terms of disk usage and
memory consumption.

# Bonus Features

Cake determines your App’s version from your git tags, to use them simply
set each target’s “Version” to: `$(SEMANTIC_PROJECT_VERSION)` and if you
like the “Build” number to: `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`.

> *Delicious!* We even append `-debug` to debug builds.
